This is a website/app project for my web development course at Loyola University Chicago.

Sources:
I used the Bootstrap template found here: [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#js](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#js).

I also used the bootstrap example started template found here for the nav section: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/starter-template/ 

Notes:
I did not use (e) in event related functions when there went unused because webstorm complained about this
