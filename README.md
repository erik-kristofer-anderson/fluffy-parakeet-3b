This is a website/app project for my web development course at Loyola University Chicago.

Sources:
I used the Bootstrap template found here: [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#js](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#js).

I also used the bootstrap example started template found here for the nav section: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/starter-template/ 

I used momentjs in the file moment.js from the website momentjs.com

comment: see also https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.24.0/moment.min.js for a cdn version of moment.js


I used  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation for guidance on the form validation part



notes from office hours
can use console.error

can use debugger in javascript and chrome dev tools

can preserve log in console and network

TODO: add event listeners to make functions go when page is loaded

note: skipping the more bootstrap portion for now

// from formspree instructions:
<p id="my-form-status"></p>
//end from formspree instructions

Using javascript provided by formspree for form submission with ajax
https://formspree.io/
To see the instructions you need to make a (free) form reciever


// note: I got this code from elly but found it wasn't needed
// function myAppOnLoad() {
//     $('alert').alert();
// }
//
//
// document.addEventListener('onload', myAppOnLoad);
